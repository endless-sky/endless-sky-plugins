shortDescription: A plugin mostly centered around improving the main plot.
description: Have you ever had trouble getting the Free Worlds campaign to start,
  or accidentally failed a key mission? Have you ever thought that all sides were
  equally bad or wanted to join an unimplemented side? Have you ever wondered what
  happened to the Mark II Syndicate ships? Well, you will not be able to join the
  Navy, and joining the Syndicate requires the Crisis in Management plugin, but otherwise,
  this plugin is for you.
