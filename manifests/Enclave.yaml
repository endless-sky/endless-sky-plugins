shortDescription: The Enclave focuses around the discovery of an isolated group of
  humans in a distant galaxy. Separated from the rest of their species for over half
  a millennium, how have these people developed?
description: The Enclave is a story-driven plugin focused on the discovery of an isolated
  group of humans stranded, hundreds of years ago, in another galaxy. I'd recommend
  you have a large Tier 2 fleet at least to complete the (admittedly still in-progress)
  story. Special thanks to Derpy Horse (https://github.com/Amazinite) for adding the
  animated stars.
