description: >
  Adds a Kestrel variant with all possible upgrades in one (with 18
  gun ports!) after you have unlocked the first one. After completing the
  Kestrel mission chain, the new variant is unlocked after 4 months and you are
  notified about it. If you activate this plugin after you have already
  completed the missions, the timer starts from then.
