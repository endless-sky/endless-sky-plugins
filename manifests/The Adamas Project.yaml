description: This plugin adds a race of highly advanced Tier 2 - 3 aliens known as
  the Adamas to the northeast section of the galaxy, accessible through wormholes.
  The aliens are friendly, but they have their own versions of pirates. The Scavengers
  have their own galaxy that they live in, and from which they mount raids upon the
  Adamas. Be careful you do not get in their way, as some of their ships are armed
  with stolen quarg tech!
