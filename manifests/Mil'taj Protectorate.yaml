description: 'Hi I am the original author of the Amalgamation plugin, while I have
  gotten back into Endless Sky recently my ideas of polish have changed greatly over
  these 4 years.

  I decided that while I wasn''t satisfied with Amalgamation as a whole, but a race
  of aliens from the plugin Shields up were still interesting to me, and something
  I wanted in the game all these years later.

  This is my attempt to morph the Mil''taj into their own fully functional developed
  race, with a simple opening mission chain and plenty of lore.

  It is recommended to avoid the Mil''taj storyline until you can at least defeat
  a Wardragon, otherwise you will have a bad time.

  ATM you can choose to either align yourself with the Mil''taj against the Quarg,
  or make them an enemy. I do not plan to ever have a Quarg side to the campaign,
  they just want you to piss off.

  Currently something I cannot do myself is art. So the mil''taj licences are just
  wanderer licences until I can get custom ones.

  For the rest of the plugin all art assets are taken from dead plugins that years
  ago I worked on updating to the then current game version.

  The idealised goal would be to replace them all with custom assets just for this
  plugin, but I doubt that will happen, so I''m mainly hoping someone will be interested
  in adding their own custom made Mil''taj licences for the plugin.
