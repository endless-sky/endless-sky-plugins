shortDescription: Endless Sky plugin giving the player access to all ships and outfits.
description: This plugin was made to allow content creators to have access to all
  outfits in a single place, for the purpose of designing and testing outfit loadouts
  for new ships. Of course, it can also be used by people who want to ruin the game
  for themselves by getting a massive fleet without needing to work for it.
