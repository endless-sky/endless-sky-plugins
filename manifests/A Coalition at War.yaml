shortDescription: Pick a side in the war between the Coalition and Quarg. I am looking
  for story and mission suggestions https://github.com/mathwhiz1212/A-Coalition-At-War/
description: You hear a lot about the conflict between the Coalition and the Quarg
  in Endless Sky, but you never see it. This plugin introduces a storyline that lets
  you see or join that conflict. You can loot Quarg ships or capture Heliarch ships
  depending on the side you choose. You can start the few implemented missions by
  landing on "Tebuteb's Table" in the Tebuteb system and accept the anamoly mission.
