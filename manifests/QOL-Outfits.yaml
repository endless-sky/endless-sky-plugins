shortDescription: An offshoot of my Amalgamation plugin from 4 years ago, I wanted
  to bring some of the old QOL outfits from that collection of plugins back into the
  modern Endless Sky landscape. Hope you enjoy.
description: 'Hi I am the original author of the Amalgamation plugin, while I have
  gotten back into Endless Sky recently my ideas of polish have changed greatly over
  these 4 years.

  I decided that while I wasn''t satisfied with Amalgamation as a whole, many of the
  outfits from plugins like Shields up were still interesting to me, and something
  I wanted in the game all these years later.

  So rather than uploading a massive plugin that turns away many people by its sheer
  size again, I would upload this, a small quality of life plugin that adds many of
  the smaller outfits I personally believe make building ships more fun overall.

  I am also working on an independent plugin for the Shields Up ''Mil''taj'' race,
  since that was where I put the most effort and had the most interest when making
  Amalgamation back in the day.

  This Plugin adds a new armoury outfit that allows you to equip powerful boarding
  weaponry, while costing upkeep and space. A smaller outfit space expansion, external
  fuel pods, extended bunk rooms, a handful of basic human outfits to add a slight
  bit of variation and huge tier 5 radiant engines along with a small tier 0.

  No other plugins are needed with this and implementation into the grander game is
  minimal outside of outfitters, since most of these are mostly for player use rather
  than to make AI ships more interesting.
