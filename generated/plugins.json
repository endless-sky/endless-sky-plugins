    "description": "Hi I am the original author of the Amalgamation plugin, while I have gotten back into Endless Sky recently my ideas of polish have changed greatly over these 4 years.\nI decided that while I wasn't satisfied with Amalgamation as a whole, many of the outfits from plugins like Shields up were still interesting to me, and something I wanted in the game all these years later.\nSo rather than uploading a massive plugin that turns away many people by its sheer size again, I would upload this, a small quality of life plugin that adds many of the smaller outfits I personally believe make building ships more fun overall.\nI am also working on an independent plugin for the Shields Up 'Mil'taj' race, since that was where I put the most effort and had the most interest when making Amalgamation back in the day.\nThis Plugin adds a new armoury outfit that allows you to equip powerful boarding weaponry, while costing upkeep and space. A smaller outfit space expansion, external fuel pods, extended bunk rooms, a handful of basic human outfits to add a slight bit of variation and huge tier 5 radiant engines along with a small tier 0.\nNo other plugins are needed with this and implementation into the grander game is minimal outside of outfitters, since most of these are mostly for player use rather than to make AI ships more interesting.\nReccomended Plugins\nhttps://github.com/demolish238/Mil-taj-Protectorate/tree/main (Mil'taj Protectorate) (My other plugin)\nhttps://github.com/demolish238/Korath-Retribution (Korath Retribution) (My other plugin)\nhttps://github.com/demolish238/Capitalis-Major (Capitalis Major) (My other plugin)\nUsed Plugins\nhttps://github.com/Amazinite/Shields-Up (Shields Up)\nhttps://github.com/Amazinite/Enigma-Corp (Enigma Corps)\nhttps://www.nexusmods.com/endlesssky/mods/1 (Space Conversion)\nIf you have any feedback on balance problems or bugs please message me on discord (demolish238#6398)",

    "description": "Hi I am the original author of the Amalgamation plugin, while I have gotten back into Endless Sky recently my ideas of polish have changed greatly over these 4 years.\nI decided that while I wasn't satisfied with Amalgamation as a whole, but a race of aliens from the plugin Shields up were still interesting to me, and something I wanted in the game all these years later.\nThis is my attempt to morph the Mil'taj into their own fully functional developed race, with a simple opening mission chain and plenty of lore.\nIt is recommended to avoid the Mil'taj storyline until you can at least defeat a Wardragon, otherwise you will have a bad time.\nATM you can choose to either align yourself with the Mil'taj against the Quarg, or make them an enemy. I do not plan to ever have a Quarg side to the campaign, they just want you to piss off.\nCurrently something I cannot do myself is art. So the mil'taj licences are just wanderer licences until I can get custom ones.\nFor the rest of the plugin all art assets are taken from dead plugins that years ago I worked on updating to the then current game version.\nThe idealised goal would be to replace them all with custom assets just for this plugin, but I doubt that will happen, so I'm mainly hoping someone will be interested in adding their own custom made Mil'taj licences for the plugin.\nReccomended Plugins\nhttps://github.com/1010todd/Beyond-the-Sky (Beyond the Sky) (Makes the Quarg actually scary as a threat and makes the higher tier Mil'taj ships make sense in comparison)\nhttps://github.com/demolish238/QOL-Outfits (QOL outfits) (My other plugin)\nhttps://github.com/demolish238/Korath-Retribution (Korath Retribution) (My other plugin)\nhttps://github.com/demolish238/Capitalis-Major (Capitalis Major) (My other plugin)\nUsed Plugins\nhttps://github.com/Amazinite/Shields-Up (Shields Up) (The original creator of the Mil'taj)\nhttps://github.com/Makuta-Miras/The-Enclave/tree/master (Enclave) (For Mil'taj weapons and outfits)\nhttps://github.com/mdsmestad/ES-COTSA-Pluggin (Cultures of the Southern Arm) (For the Avendri Ships)\nhttps://tearcellgames.itch.io/cosmic-canidae-assets (Mal'korbra assets)\nhttps://github.com/MidnightPlugins/Lost-in-Midnight (Lost in Midnight) (Damaged Jump Drive Image)\nIf you have any feedback on balance problems or bugs please message me on discord (demolish238#6398)",
