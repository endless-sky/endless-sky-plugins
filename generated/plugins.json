I do not plan to ever have a Quarg side to the campaign, they just want you to piss off.\nCurrently something I cannot do myself is art. So the mil'taj licences are just wanderer licences until I can get custom ones.\nFor the rest of the plugin all art assets are taken from dead plugins that years ago I worked on updating to the then current game version.\nThe idealised goal would be to replace them all with custom assets just for this plugin, but I doubt that will happen, so I'm mainly hoping someone will be interested in adding their own custom made Mil'taj licences for the plugin.\nReccomended Plugins\nhttps://github.com/1010todd/Beyond-the-Sky (Beyond the Sky) (Makes the Quarg actually scary as a threat and makes the higher tier Mil'taj ships make sense in comparison)\nhttps://github.com/demolish238/QOL-Outfits (QOL outfits) (My other plugin)\nhttps://github.com/demolish238/Korath-Retribution (Korath Retribution) (My other plugin)\nhttps://github.com/demolish238/Capitalis-Major (Capitalis Major) (My other plugin)\nUsed Plugins\nhttps://github.com/Amazinite/Shields-Up (Shields Up) (The original creator of the Mil'taj)\nhttps://github.com/Makuta-Miras/The-Enclave/tree/master (Enclave) (For Mil'taj weapons and outfits)\nhttps://github.com/mdsmestad/ES-COTSA-Pluggin (Cultures of the Southern Arm) (For the Avendri Ships)\nhttps://tearcellgames.itch.io/cosmic-canidae-assets (Mal'korbra assets)\nhttps://github.com/MidnightPlugins/Lost-in-Midnight (Lost in Midnight) (Damaged Jump Drive Image)\nIf you have any feedback on balance problems or bugs please message me on discord (demolish238#6398)",
