  "shortDescription": "An offshoot of my Amalgamation plugin from 4 years ago, I wanted to bring some of the old QOL outfits from that collection of plugins back into the modern Endless Sky landscape. Hope you enjoy.",
  "description": "Hi I am the original author of the Amalgamation plugin, while I have gotten back into Endless Sky recently my ideas of polish have changed greatly over these 4 years.\nI decided that while I wasn't satisfied with Amalgamation as a whole, many of the outfits from plugins like Shields up were still interesting to me, and something I wanted in the game all these years later.\nSo rather than uploading a massive plugin that turns away many people by its sheer size again, I would upload this, a small quality of life plugin that adds many of the smaller outfits I personally believe make building ships more fun overall.\nI am also working on an independent plugin for the Shields Up 'Mil'taj' race, since that was where I put the most effort and had the most interest when making Amalgamation back in the day.\nThis Plugin adds a new armoury outfit that allows you to equip powerful boarding weaponry, while costing upkeep and space. A smaller outfit space expansion, external fuel pods, extended bunk rooms, a handful of basic human outfits to add a slight bit of variation and huge tier 5 radiant engines along with a small tier 0.\nNo other plugins are needed with this and implementation into the grander game is minimal outside of outfitters, since most of these are mostly for player use rather than to make AI ships more interesting.\nReccomended Plugins\nhttps://github.com/demolish238/Mil-taj-Protectorate/tree/main (Mil'taj Protectorate) (My other plugin)\nhttps://github.com/demolish238/Korath-Retribution (Korath Retribution) (My other plugin)\nhttps://github.com/demolish238/Capitalis-Major (Capitalis Major) (My other plugin)\nUsed Plugins\nhttps://github.com/Amazinite/Shields-Up (Shields Up)\nhttps://github.com/Amazinite/Enigma-Corp (Enigma Corps)\nhttps://www.nexusmods.com/endlesssky/mods/1 (Space Conversion)\nIf you have any feedback on balance problems or bugs please message me on discord (demolish238#6398)",
