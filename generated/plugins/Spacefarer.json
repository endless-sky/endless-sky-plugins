  "description": "As a captain, you're responsible for the lives of your crew.  Loss of life is inevitable in the merciless reaches of space.  You stick to exploration, ferrying, and fleet combat.  If anyone dies, it will be everyone when the ship explodes.  This plugin adds replay value by forcing the player to discover alternate and competing forms of income in order to efficiently obtain a fleet.",
