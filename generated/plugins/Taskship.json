  "description": "What if people actually looked at your ship and gave you appropriate jobs? What if you could turn a profit using your old Flivver for hauling joyriders up to orbit, or join mock battles in your Osprey to thrill the galaxy's dedicated 31st-century-television-equivalent viewers? Well, now you can. Taskship is a pure content plugin designed to improve the vanilla experience by offering jobs aimed specifically at captains of certain ships.",
