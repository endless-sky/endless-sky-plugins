# endless-sky-plugins

This repository is intended to become the central plug-in index for [Endless Sky](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/). It hosts the plugin manifests in the `manifest` folder as well as autogenerated machine-readable formats in the `generated` folder.

See [Plugins.md](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky-plugins/blob/master/generated/PLUGINS.md) for a list of indexed plugins.

Contributions only need to modify their respective plugin manifests. See [the plugin_index RFC](https://github.com/endless-sky/rfcs/blob/main/rfcs/0001-plugin-index.md) for the manifest's specification.
